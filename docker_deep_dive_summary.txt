ch.4
    1. Can think of images as "class", container as "instance". Surely they are not the same
    2. inspect container shell with docker run -it
    3. git pull a directory, build an image and run it as container. pretty cool.

ch.5 the docker engine
    high-level view:
    1. daemon : used to be a bulk of what "docker" is, continously being refactor and modularized.
    REST API, authentication, orchestration, security, core networkingmodulized

    2. containerd: manage container lifecycle operations - start|stop|pause|rm,
    but it also involve in image push / pull overtime.
    3. runc - single purpose: create containers

    Now that all essential container function is pulled out from daemon,
    it is possible to upgrade docker daemon version without stopping
    any container.

    rest of the chapter is just setting up key-pairs security stuff, skipped.
